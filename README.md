# Opacus-DPCR
 We extend the widely used framework Opacus for private learning and design a new framework Opacus-DPCR to support differential privacy continuous data release (DPCR) for private learning. Opacus-DPCR integrates various DPCR models (including our proposed BCRG and ABCRG) and keeps high compatibility with the original Opacus framework. Users can extend the Opacus-based private FL implementation to an Opacus-DPCR-based implementation by modifying a few lines of code.
